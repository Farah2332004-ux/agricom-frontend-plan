# üí∞ Sales Management ‚Äì Frontend Plan

This section outlines the breakdown of all **pages**, **components**, and **estimated times** for building the **Sales Management** module. The module includes multiple views depending on filters applied (Clients / Crops) and temporal scope (short-term vs long-term).

Each view includes a forecasted grid, interactive insights, and togglable indicators. Implementation is organized by page, with reused components noted.
